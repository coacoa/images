== Step 1: Basic NixOS ==
User -> System : edit configuration.nix
System -> System : define basic services, packages

== Step 2: Home Manager (non-flake) ==
User -> HM : enable home-manager in configuration.nix
System -> HM : apply home-manager configs via nixos-rebuild

== Step 3: Flake Migration ==
User -> Flake : write flake.nix\n(inputs, outputs)
Flake -> System : load configuration.nix
Flake -> HM : import home.nix\nfrom flake module
System -> System : rebuild using flake\n(--flake .#hostname)

== Step 4: Overlay Introduction ==
User -> Overlay : define overlays in flake.nix
Overlay -> Flake : overlays = [ ... ]
Flake -> System : apply overlay via nixpkgs.overlays
